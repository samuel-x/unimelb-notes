# unimelb-notes

**Hello!**

My name is Samuel Xu. I'm studying Computing Systems and Software at The Unviersity of Melbourne.

I've always enjoyed making notes before an exam. Although I've been a decidedly average student, I found that some of my peers liked my notes.
So, I've decided to upload whatever I write for the rest of my courses!

Hopefully you will find these useful :smiley:

<sub>p.s. I am not responsible for any possible bodily harm, anxiety, depression, loss of marks or allergies to seafood that may arise from using these notes.</sub>

**Good Luck, and Godspeed!**

### 2018 (Semester 1) Work in Progress :construction:

This semester I decided to experiment using Markdown instead. It's a more universal format than the [Notes](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Notes) syntax I previously used and, more importantly, renders nicely in GitHub and allows the use of inline images. I wrote everything using Sublime Text with the [ImagePaste](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ImagePaste) package, which allows you to `Ctrl+V` images into Sublime. I also used [Markdown Preview](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownPreview) which allows you to preview your Markdown text as you write it!

*Note:* As Markdown allows use of inline images you should preserve the original file structure.

- [**Computer Systems (COMP30023)**](COMP30023)
	- (06/04/18) Completed up till week 6
	- (21/05/18) Completed the last Tutorial/Lecture
	- Crazy dense subject on networks. It's pretty good so far. :+1:
- [**Software Modelling and Design (SWEN30006)**](SWEN30006)
	- If you thought database systems was dry and uncoordinated, wait till you do this subject
	- Really inconsistent, conflicting information
	- Feels more like a section that we should've learnt about in OOSD and then never touched again
	- Head tutor for my year had a reputation for not being a great tutor
	- It's core for the Computer Science major, so prepare yourself. Hopefully it's better by then.
- [**Artificial Intelligence (COMP30024)**](COMP30024)
	- (31/05/18) Exam notes halfway completed
	- (04/06/18) Exam notes completed
	- Feels like an extension of Design of Algorithms. More search algorithms and some cool probability/machine learning stuff. It's pretty fun.
		- Contains [`examrev.md`](COMP30024/examrev.md), a short exam revision summary of the course and [`ai.pdf`](COMP30024/ai.pdf), a long, messy, 89-page set of notes which covers the course from start to end. Thanks to [@joannag6](https://github.com/joannag6) for sticking with me this sem! 

### 2017 (Semester 2)

Most of these notes were made with the [Notes](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Notes) syntax and exported to pdf with the [Export to HTML](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ExportHtml) package, both for Sublime Text. Hopefully these haven't deprecated just yet!
- [**Object Oriented Software Development (SWEN20003)**](SWEN20003)
	- Pretty much a Crash Course in Java. Covers the basics of programming to some object oriented concepts such as polymorphism and abstract classes.
- [**Database Systems (INFO20003)**](INFO20003)
	- Content includes SQL, query processing and some database theory. 
	- <sub>also the content was really dry and it wasn't taught well due to new management but don't tell them i said that</sub>
- [**Declarative Programming (COMP30020 or COMP90048)**](COMP30020)
	- By far one of the better courses I've taken. Teaches the basics of Functional and Declarative Programming. Content includes how Haskell and Prolog work.
	- However notes only covers the Haskell section as the Prolog section was lost to time :disappointed:
